# A Simple Tic Tac Toe
While doing the C# Programming from Zero to Hero : The Fundamentals in Udemy the latest challenge was to create a Tic Tac Toe Game to try out some of the concepts the course provides.
Well, Here It Is.



## Deployment

Simply download or clone the code and open in the most current Visual Studio Version!
You shoul be able to execute with no fuss, we have just two classes, the Program and the TicTacToeBoard.
Once build in VS hit play or [f5] to execute and play!
- *The Console Will Provide Basic Instructions on How to Play*

## Features

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code utilizes classes and objects to organize the logic of the Tic-Tac-Toe game. The TicTacToeBoard class encapsulates the game's state and behavior.
- Encapsulation: The TicTacToeBoard class encapsulates the game's state (board) and behavior (methods like MakeMove, IsGameFinished, etc.). This helps in maintaining code integrity and modularity.
- Methods and Functions: The code defines various methods to perform specific tasks, such as initializing the board, displaying the board, making a move, checking for a winner, and checking if the board is full.
- Conditional Statements: Conditional statements like if, else, and switch are used to implement game logic, handle user input validation, and determine game outcomes (win, lose, draw).
- Looping Constructs: The while loop is used to control the flow of the game, allowing it to continue until a game-ending condition is met.
- Arrays: A 2D array (board) is used to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board, where each cell holds the symbol of the player ('X' or 'O').
- Input/Output Operations: The code interacts with the user through console input (Console.ReadLine) and output (Console.WriteLine), allowing players to input their moves and displaying the game state.
- Error Handling: The code includes basic error handling to validate user input and prevent invalid moves.
- Code Organization: The code is organized into multiple classes (TicTacToeBoard and Program) to improve readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns.
- Code Reusability: The PlayGame method encapsulates the game loop, promoting code reusability and modularity. This method can be called to start a new game whenever needed.
